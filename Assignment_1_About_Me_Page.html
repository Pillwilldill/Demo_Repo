    <h1>About Me: Christopher Cao</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Christopher Cao and I am in my 4th year at CSUSB. 
       I am a computer engineering major hoping to build a career
       from what I have learned from all my CSE courses. Depending on the job market's performance
       in the future, I may or may not be hired at a tech company for a tech related job such as a 
       data analyst. Even if I do not get hired by a tech company, I plan to use all the skills and 
       knowledge from my CSE courses to be able to work tech related jobs at companies that are not 
       neccessarily tech companies.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and reading manga and webtoons. I enjoy genres such
       as action adventure and platforming although I am open to other genres. Recently I have been hooked
       onto cinematic adventure games such as God of War (2018) for their story telling and pushing the boundary 
       for what is possible in a video game. When it comes to manga and webtoons, I am biased toward romance
       as I enjoy watching the lead characters in comedic scenarios and how they overcome a variety of obstacles 
       to be able to remain as a couple.</p>

    <p>Along with playing video games and reading, I have been learning about long term financial stability
       on the side and have even begun investing in low cost index ETFs through the brokerage Robinhood. 
       While I am not double majoring in financial concentration, I believe I have adequate knowledge on topics 
       such as high yield savings accounts, certificates of deposits (CDS), high historical returns, and more. The 
       only difficult part so far is learning how to optimally budget between how much I can invest and 
       how mach I can immediately spend. </p>

        Closing: I hope to meet the class' expectation of me and 
            to hopefully use what I learned in CSE 4500 in my
            future endeavors.
